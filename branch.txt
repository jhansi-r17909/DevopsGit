A branch in Git is like a separate workspace where you can develop features or fix bugs without affecting the main branch.
It allows multiple developers to work simultaneously without overwriting each other's work.

Why Use Branches?
Work on new features without disturbing the main branch.
Easy to test and review before merging.
Allows multiple developers to work on different tasks independently.
